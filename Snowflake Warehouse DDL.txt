This SQL script is intended for creating a data warehouse in Snowflake. The script includes the following steps:
1. Drop the existing database if it exists.
2. Create a new database named 'city_database' if it does not exist.
3. Create a warehouse named 'city_warehouse' if it does not exist.
4. Create a new schema named 'new_city_schema'.
5. Create a staging table ('snowflake_ext_stage_yml') pointing to the S3 Bucket with AWS credentials.
6. List the contents of the created stage.
7. Define a file format named 'csv_format' for CSV files with specific delimiters and header skipping.
8. View data from the 'city_info' table after data is loaded using Airflow 


Note: Ensure that AWS credentials are kept secure and managed appropriately.

-- Step 1: Drop the existing database if it exists
DROP DATABASE IF EXISTS city_database;

-- Step 2: Select data from the 'new_city_schema' schema within the 'city_database'
SELECT * FROM city_database.new_city_schema;

-- Step 3: Create a new database named 'city_database' if it does not exist
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS city_database;

-- Step 4: Create a warehouse named 'city_warehouse' if it does not exist
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS city_warehouse;

-- Step 5: Create a new schema named 'new_city_schema'
CREATE SCHEMA new_city_schema;

-- Step 6: Create a staging table ('snowflake_ext_stage_yml') pointing to the S3 Bucket with AWS credentials
CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE city_database.new_city_schema.snowflake_ext_stage_yml 
URL='s3://airflow-snow-email-bucket-1/'
CREDENTIALS=(AWS_KEY_ID='##############'
             AWS_SECRET_KEY='################################');

-- Step 7: List the contents of the created stage
LIST @city_database.new_city_schema.snowflake_ext_stage_yml;

-- Step 8: Define a file format named 'csv_format' for CSV files with specific delimiters and header skipping
CREATE OR REPLACE FILE FORMAT csv_format
    TYPE = 'CSV'
    FIELD_DELIMITER = ','
    RECORD_DELIMITER = '\n'
    SKIP_HEADER = 1;

-- Step 9: View data from the 'city_info' table
SELECT * FROM city_info;
